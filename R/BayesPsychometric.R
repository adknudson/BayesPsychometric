#' BayesPsychometric: A package for fitting psychometric functions using the
#'   power of Bayesian statistics and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling.
#'
#' The BayesPsychometric provides two main functions: 1) `bayesPF` which will
#'   fit a logistic model using Stan, and 2) `f2stan` which builds up the
#'   Stan code from a formula and data frame.
